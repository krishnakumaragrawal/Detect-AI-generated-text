# Detect-AI-generated-text

This is an project based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) i.e. Machine Learning on text which detect AI generated paragraphs. In this project, I have 
trained a ML (NLP) model based on the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/llm-detect-ai-generated-text-dataset). 
Then I have depoyed that model to a web page app for better functionality. 

This app Classifies the text generated by AI tools like chatGPT, Bart etc. This app will exactly predict and give output the probability percentage of AI generated text
v/s the Human Written text. Since this model has been trained on Third Party limited data, so it will not perform in real time but we can real

## Technology Used
1. Python
2. Text Vectorization (countVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer)
3. ML Classification Algorithms (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.)
4. Spacy (For Preprocessing of text's data)
5. Backend Application (Flask)
6. Web Apps (HTML, CSS, JS)
